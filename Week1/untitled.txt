The Command window is a place where you can run specific lines of code for 
immediate results, here is where you can do basic math calculations like 
1+2=3, you can also set variables here like Twenty=20 and then they will 
save in your workspace. The workspace is a unique window, here all your 
variables that you use in your command window are saved and ready to be 
reused, one thing I noticed is that your answer to your most recent 
calculation is always saves as ans, so if you want to use the answer to 
your last calculation you can just type ans. The editor window is where 
we will run and write script, this will be saved each time you edit code
 or save a MATLAB file. Finally the current folder window shows you what 
folder you are currently editing and also is a place where you can navigate
 multiple open files you may be working on.
