    When I tried to run the original buggy script I ran into errors 
around the use of the display function and then also naming the variables.
As far as naming the variables goes the original creator forgot to add a 
semi colon, a semi colon prevents the variables from being shown in the 
command window when you don't want them to be. To fix this add a semi colon
directly after your variable naming lines of code. The next issue I found
was incorrect use of the disp function, here I switched the disp function 
to an fprintf function and added a .3f\n float to stop showing the area 
after 3 decimals, now the code works as intended!
    I learned alot about matlab from debugging this set of code, mainly
I got more familiar with the fprintf function and also learned what 
semicolons do!
