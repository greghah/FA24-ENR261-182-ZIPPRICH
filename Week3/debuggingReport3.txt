The first thing I noticed when examining the buggy script 3 was that the 
if else and elif statements were on the same line as the code it was 
examining, to fix this I deleted and rewrote the if elseif and else 
statements above the line of code it previously was on, adding indents when
 needed of course. There also was
missing a end comand after the last else statement line. The next thing I 
added was a i=i+2 counter inside of the while loop. This modification 
ensures that the i variable is changed each time the loop is ran. 
After these changes I tested the code and it ran as intended. I also
added a few semicolons to prevent leaking my code.
